# OpenTimerResolution
OpenTimerResolution is a lightweight open-source application that sets the timer resolution of the Windows system Timer to a specified value. Running the program with the `-minimized` argument will start the program, force the timer resolution of 0.5ms and minimize itself to tray.

**In order for the program to take effect, it needs to be running in the background.**
