# OpenTimerResolution
OpenTimerResolution is a lightweight open-source application that changes the resolution of the Windows system Timer to a specified value. Running the program with the `-minimized` argument will start the program, force the timer resolution of 0.5ms and minimize itself to tray.

There's also the option to run it at startup minimized (since v1.0.2.0). 

**In order for the program to take effect, it needs to be running in the background.** 

.NET 6.0 SDK is required to build the project: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0
