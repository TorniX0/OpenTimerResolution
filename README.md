OpenTimerResolution is a lightweight open-source application that changes the resolution of the Windows system Timer to a specified value and has a memory cache cleaner included. Running the program with the `-minimized` argument will start the program, force the timer resolution of 0.5ms, enable the memory cache cleaner automatically (since v1.0.3.0) and minimize itself to tray. You can log the actual resolution of the Windows system Timer, then save it into a `.log` file. (since v1.0.2.3)

There's also the option to run it at startup minimized (since v1.0.2.0).

You can also enable dark mode (since v1.0.2.4).



**In order for the program to take effect, it needs to be running in the background.**
